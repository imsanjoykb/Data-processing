Job Descriptions:
Efficient control of the visible light at the nanoscale dimensions is important for future light-on-chip integration. It requires sub-diffraction nanophotonic elements which are often functionally similar but conceptually different from conventional optical elements. The field of optical nanoantennas has emerged offering the promising solutions for this problem. Most optical nanoantennas studied so far consist of plasmonic nanoparticles. The main drawback of using plasmonic structures in the VIS-NIR frequency range is their intrinsic losses which strongly degrades nanodevice and system performance. An exciting alternative solution to metal nanoantennas based on resonant high-refractive index dielectric nanoparticles is underway at IMRE. These novel low-loss resonant nanostructures can complement or even substitute plamonics for many applications. IMRE seeks a candidate who will work on design and simulations of dielectric nanoantennas , metasurfaces and other on-chip nanodevices. He/she should be able to work closely with IMRE's experimental team and provide designs, modelling and simulations of the studied nanodevices.","Requirements
